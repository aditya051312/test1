Rain is a beautiful natural phenomenon which adds charm to our mother Earth. It brings life to vegetation and gives a fresh look to the parched lands during hot summers. The sweet smell of soil after a rain shower, is loved by everyone. Rain is vital for the cycle of nature. It brings water to reservoirs and quenches the thirst of wild animals in the forests. It plays a crucial role in agriculture as many regions in the world depend on rainfall for farming. Rain also affects the economy - too little or too much rainfall can harm agriculture, leading to a fall in crop yields. On the other hand, rain can cause floods which can lead to destruction. However, despite its drawbacks, rain is beautiful and a blessing to life on earth.
