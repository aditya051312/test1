Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to perform specific tasks without explicit instructions. ML algorithms use patterns and inference to make decisions and predictions based on data. There are various types of ML, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. ML finds applications in diverse fields such as healthcare, finance, marketing, and more, revolutionizing how tasks are automated and insights are derived from data.
