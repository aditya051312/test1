Each component will have its own `.ts`, `.html`, and `.css` file. The `.ts` file will contain the logic for the component, the `.html` file will contain the template for the component, and the `.css` file will contain the styles for the component.

The service files will contain methods for interacting with the backend API. These methods will be used by the components to get data from the backend and perform operations like create, read, update, and delete.

The `app.module.ts` file is the main module file where we declare all our components and import necessary modules.

The `app.component.ts`, `app.component.html`, and `app.component.css` files are the main component files. The main component is the root component of the application.

The `main.ts` file is the entry point of the application, and the `index.html` file is the main HTML file that gets served when someone visits our application.

The `package.json` file contains the list of dependencies for our application.

Finally, we'll push all our code to the main branch of the GitHub repository. We'll use Git for version control, and GitHub as our remote repository.

Here's an example of how you could structure your GitHub repository:
