Cats are small, carnivorous mammals that are often kept as pets. They are one of humanity's oldest and most beloved pets. Going back to ancient times, Egyptians worshiped cats and even mummified them, just like humans. Cats are known for being independent, although they can also be affectionate and loving. Cats' bodies are extremely flexible; they have quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice. They can see in near darkness and have a better sense of smell than humans. Despite these advantages, it is still common for cats to fail when trying to pounce on their prey. In conclusion, cats are fascinating creatures with a long history with humans and many abilities that have helped them survive and thrive in a variety of environments.
