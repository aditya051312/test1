Dogs are a type of domesticated animal. They are a subspecies of the gray wolf and are related to foxes and jackals. They are social creatures and are highly adaptable to different environments. They have been bred over thousands of years for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dogs are often referred to as 'man's best friend' because they can perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding disabled individuals. This influence on human society has given them the nickname 'man's best friend' in the Western world.
