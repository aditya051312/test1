The Universe is a vast, mysterious expanse that contains everything that exists. It includes all galaxies, stars, planets, and all other forms of matter and energy. The observable Universe is estimated to be about 93 billion light years in diameter. It is continually expanding, a phenomenon confirmed by the Hubble's law. The Universe is believed to be at least 13.8 billion years old, based on the cosmic microwave background radiation. Scientists study the Universe using various types of telescopes that detect different types of energies, such as visible light, radio waves, X-rays, and gamma rays. The study of the Universe is called cosmology.
