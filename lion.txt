The lion is known as the king of the jungle. It is one of the largest cats in the world, second only to the tiger. Lions are found in Africa and India. They live in groups called prides, which consist of related females, their offspring, and a small number of adult males. Male lions are easily recognized by their manes. Lions are carnivores and they hunt a variety of animals. Their powerful roars can be heard up to 8 km away. Lions spend a lot of their time resting and are inactive for about 20 hours per day. Despite their large size, lions are not the fastest runners, but they have great strength and agility. They are also excellent swimmers. Lions are a vulnerable species with their population declining due to habitat loss and conflicts with humans. However, they are still a symbol of strength and bravery.
