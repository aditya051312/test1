Elephants are the largest land animals currently existing. They are known for their intelligence, memory and complex social structures. Elephants are herbivores, spending up to 16 hours a day eating plants. They consume as much as 150 kg of food per day. There are two species: the African elephant and the Asian elephant. African elephants are larger, have bigger ears and concave backs, while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs. Elephants have a gestation period of 22 months, the longest of any land animal. At birth, an elephant calf weighs about 100 kg. Elephants have a lifespan of up to 70 years. They communicate using a variety of sounds, movements and touch. Elephants play a crucial role in their ecosystems by, for example, creating clearings in the vegetation to allow new plants to grow. However, elephants are threatened by habitat loss and poaching for their ivory tusks.
