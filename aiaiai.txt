Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a fascinating field of computer science. It focuses on the creation of intelligent machines that can react and work like humans. The core problems of AI include programming computers for traits such as knowledge, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, learning, planning, and language understanding. AI is now a part of our everyday life and is used in a wide range of sectors including healthcare, education, entertainment, services, and transportation. AI can perform tasks such as identifying patterns in the data more efficiently than human beings, enabling businesses to gain more insight out of their data. AI technologies like machine learning are essential in processing and understanding the large amount of digital information. With its exceptional growth rate, AI is expected to open new fronts in the field of technology and science in the near future.
