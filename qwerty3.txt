Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines. It has become an essential part of the technology industry. AI is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages. AI has the potential to vastly change the way that humans interact with the digital world, as well as the job market, and has already been incorporated into various industries including healthcare, automotive, and finance.
