Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly advancing technology, made possible by the Internet, that may soon have significant impacts on our everyday lives. AI traditionally refers to an artificial creation of human-like intelligence that can learn, reason, plan, perceive, or process natural language. These traits allow AI to bring immense socioeconomic opportunities, while also posing ethical and socio-economic challenges. As the technology of AI continues to improve, future developments are expected to include a shift from rule-based systems to learning-based systems. This shift will bring about a significant increase in the types and complexity of AI applications. While the future is uncertain, it is clear that AI will play a significant role in our lives in the future. AI has the potential to provide a multitude of benefits, including increased efficiency, improved decision making, and a better understanding of the world around us. However, these benefits must be balanced against the potential risks and challenges that AI presents.
